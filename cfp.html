			   <p>Information Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged as a promising paradigm for shaping the Future Internet (FI) architectures. 
			  ICN moves from the host-centric to the information-centric networking in order to decouple the delivery of contents from their original locations. 
			  With that, the opportunity arises to fetch contents and services from virtually everywhere, including pushing the information closer to the end user. 
			  The latter aspect allows for optimizing bandwidth utilization and improving the service availability, especially in challenged network environments. 
			  Particular ICN aspects that facilitate such optimization are, among others, the support for in-networking caching, the naming of content while only creating 
			  temporary relationships between those providing and those asking for content, the potential to utilize multipath communication and supporting native multicast delivery 
			  (due to the spatial and temporary decoupling of publishers and receivers).
 </p>
			 <p> In most developing regions, residential Internet access is considerably less affordable due to the experienced income levels. People living in rural communities of these 
			 regions either suffer from lacking of Internet access or poor Internet connectivity. This has led to limited opportunity for rural communities to connect to the world and has significantly caused a digital divide. 
			 The advantages offered by ICN along with wireless access and distribution technologies (TV White Spaces, satellite communications or Wi-Fi based long distance networks) introduce potential to improve the Internet connectivity 
			 in developing regions aiming at minimizing the cost of Internet deployment and potentially allowing commodity hardware to be an alternative. Furthermore, the recent arising of localized communication approaches, e.g., community 
			 networks and do-it-yourself networking (DIY) also bring benefits on providing a low cost solution for network deployment. With the efficient content delivery in ICN and practical low cost solutions, these capabilities will leverage affordable broadband Internet for the developing regions.
		 
 </p>	
 			<p> This workshop will provide an international forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange theoretical and practical experiences on the most recent innovations, 
 			trends and challenges in Future Internet architecture for developing regions. The objective is to explore potential solutions of ICN that make Internet broadband affordable to everyone. 
 			This special session aims to attract publications on deployment, practical experiences and system design for developing regions considering also low power constraints, energy consumption, frequent disruptions and localized caching. 
 			Furthermore, we encourage submissions on design of concrete solutions within educational, health or governmental contexts.

		    <p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 </p>
            <p>* ICN architecture design and evaluation </p>
			<p>* Facilitation of IP-based services of ICN deployments</p>
			<p>* Use of wireless access technologies for development such as TV White Spaces, satellite communications or Wi-Fi based long distance networks</p>
			<p>* Caching solutions, particularly for edge network caching</p>
			<p>* Named based routing</p>
			<p>* Privacy, security and trust for Future Internet architectures</p>
			<p>* Localized communication networks</p>
			<p>* Applications and services for developing regions</p>
			<p>* Future Internet economics and business models</p>
			<p>* Deployment and trial experiences of ICN systems</p> 
			<br>
			<!--<p>
			<h2 class="lead"><b> Call for Demos and Posters</b></h2>
			Demo proposals can be presented in two pages papers, and should convey work or conclusions 
			that are proof-of-concept implementations or a direct result of field experience. Topics of 
			interest are the same as research topics in the special session on  Future Internet Architecture for 
			Developing Regions (FI4D) call for papers. Papers accepted for demos will be presented in a special afternoon 
			session, but will not appear in the conference proceedings. It is hoped that these session will foster 
			sharing of best practices, early experiences with prototypes and/or lessons learned as well as serve as 
			interesting points for discussion during the conference.
